## Use
Please notice that there are two user system: admin and normal users.
The admin password is "123456". - You can NOT see it in the .json file - because I encrypted it.
One of the users you can use is {Alexa, 123456}. - The same as admin, you can't see the password too.
Then login and have some fun!
More details will be introduced during the presentation. See you soon!
